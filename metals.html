<h2 id="metalintro">Metals</h2>

<p align="justify">Metals in the environment come from a variety of sources, both natural and anthropogenic, and play an essential role in human health and envrionmental quality.
    In trace amounts, certain metals are essential components in plant and animal nutrition. Among these 'micronutrients' are elements such as: B, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, As, Co, Cr, Ni, Se, Sn, and V.
    Other metals in the envrionment can be considerably dangerous to plant and animal life, toxic in even trace amounts. Among the most important of these pollutants are: Ag, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, Tl, and Zn.

<h2 id="metalanalysis">Analytical Methods</h2>

<p align="justify">The ICP-MS instrument consists of two primary components: the ionization source (inductively coupled plasma) and the mass analyzer (mass spectrometer).
    Liquid samples are introduced into the ICP ionization source using a nebulizer, which generates a fine spray of sample into the mass analyzer.
    The inductively coupled plasma is an electrically conductive argon gas at very high temperatures (>10,000K) which evaporates the solvent and ionizes the sample prior to reaching the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer consists of a quadrupole mass filter consisting of two pairs of electrically conductive rods connected in series.
    Charged samples travel through the quadrupole at a rate determined by the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of the ionized atoms.
    Selected m/z ratio will reach the ion detector while other ions collide with the quadrupole rods allowing for both sensitive and selective detection.</p>
