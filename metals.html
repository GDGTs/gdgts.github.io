<h2 id="icpms">Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry</h2>

<p align="justify">Analysis of trace metals from the Hundred Acre Cove samples will be performed by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
    ICP-MS is a type of mass spectrometry used to detect metals in a sample at concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion.
    The ICP-MS can be utilized as a quantitative tool to determine the concentration of a specific analyte, or as a qualitative tool to determine the metal speciation in a sample.</p>

<p align="justify">Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique for identifying chemicals in a sample.
    Mass spectrometry relies on magnetic forces to influence the trajectory of ions traveling through it,
    where the mass of the ion determines its path through the magnetic field.

<p align="justify">The ICP-MS instrument consists of two primary components: the ionization source (inductively coupled plasma) and the mass analyzer (mass spectrometer).
    Liquid samples are introduced into the ICP ionization source using a nebulizer, which generates a fine spray of sample into the mass analyzer.
    The inductively coupled plasma is an electrically conductive argon gas at very high temperatures (>10,000K) which evaporates the solvent and ionizes the sample prior to reaching the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer consists of a quadrupole mass filter consisting of two pairs of electrically conductive rods connected in series.
    Charged samples travel through the quadrupole at a rate determined by the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of the ionized atoms.
    Selected m/z ratio will reach the ion detector while other ions collide with the quadrupole rods allowing for both sensitive and selective detection.</p>
