<h2 id="nitrogen">Nitrogen</h2>
<p align="justify">Nitrogen (<span class="label label-warning">N</span>) is a ubiquitous element in biological systems and one of the primary building blocks of DNA, RNA, proteins and many other essential biological compounds. The nitrogen cycle plays a central role in maintaining the flow and balance of this essential element throughout aquatic systems in our environment. There is often a significant human influence on the nirtrogen cycle attributed to a variety of sources. Anthropogenic processeses such as agriculture, traffic, or even septic tanks, can account for more than half of the total nitrogen fixation taking place from the atmosphere every year. In natural waters, nitrogen residence times are typically short due to biological processes recycling this element at high efficiency. Physical processes of nitrogen fixation, assimilation, and metabolic pathways such as ammonification, nitrification, denitrification and ANAMMOX transform <strong>N</strong> between its major forms in natural waters.

<h2 id="phosphorous">Phosphorous</h2>
<p align="justify">Phosphorus (<span class="label label-success">P</span>) is an important nutrient that plants and animals use to synthesize DNA, RNA, and cell membranes. Like the <strong>N</strong> cycle, the <strong>P</strong> cycle has also been severely modified by humans through mining, fertilizer production, detergents, and land use change. Most <strong>P</strong> is found on the earth as the mineral apatite (<span class="label label-default">Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub></span>). This mineral is weathered in the phosphorus cycle converting it into forms that are usable by biology. The <strong>P</strong> cycle differs from many element cycles in that it does not have a significant gaseous component and it is substantially simpler than the <strong>N</strong> cycle, with most dissolved inorganic <strong>P</strong> existing as <span class="label label-default">PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup></span> or one of its derivatives. The solubility of inorganic <strong>P</strong> species is affected by pH and redox conditions, with the redox potential of sediments playing a key role in phosphorus recycling. Phosphorous is also is often characterized by low concentrations and a short residence time in natural waters. <strong>N</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are both limiting nutrients allowing them to have significant affects on the chemistry and biology of aquatic ecosystems. Inorganic <strong>N</strong> and <strong>P</strong> species are not toxic themselves, but above certain concentrations, they can be considered pollutants because they may cause eutrophication. Cultural eutrophication is the process by which aquatic ecosystems are modified by excess nutrients, sourced from anthropogenic processes. Eutrophication often results in algal blooms which lower light availability and lead to the rapid decomposition of this algal material. This process depletes oxygen concentrations and leads to fish kills, decreases in biodiversity, and decreased water quality. Algal blooms may also produce toxic compounds that have detrimental effects on other biota.</p>

<h2 id="analytical-methods">Analytical Methods</h2>
<p align="justify">The important role of nitrogen and phosphorous in the aquatic environment, demands accurate and reliable methodolody for monitoring their concentrations. For many aqueous nitrogen and phosphorous species, concentration is often determined by colorimetric spectroscopy, to quantify inorganic <strong>N</strong> and <strong>P</strong> down to the parts per billion concentration. Spectroscopy operates on the principle of molecules absorbing light proportional to the their concentration in solution. In order to maximize the absorbtion of light and increase the selectivity for a single molecular species, samples undergo a reaction targeting the desired analyte. For nitrogen and phosphorous analysis, organometallic reagents are typically used to selectively chelate the target analyte. The metal-analyte chelatation will often exhibit a unique spectroscopic signature, absorbing light of a specific wavelength. This absorbance is measured with a UV-Vis spectrometer, using sophisticated light diffraction and photodection techniques to determine the total absorbtion of a certain wavelength of light within a given sample. Absorbance is related to concentrations through <strong>Beer’s law</strong>:</p>

<center>A = a * b * c</center>
<p><br></p>

<p align="justify">Where, <b>A</b> is the absorbance of a specific wavelength of light, <b>a</b> is the molar absorptivity coefficient, <b>b</b> is the path length that the light travelled, and <b>c</b> is the concentration of the absorbing species in solution.</p>

<p>In this lab session, we will use the absorbance measurements obtained for our samples using the technique described above to calculate the concentration of various nutrients species in the Hundred Acre Cove aquatic environment. We will be targeting the analysis of NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, PO<sub>4</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> from our <strong>Hundred Acre Cove</strong> samples using a Westco SmartChem200 UV-Vis spectrometer, a research grade analytical instrument designed specifically for high throughput environmental workflows.</p>

<h2 id="calibration-standards">Calibration Standards</h2>

<p align="justify">Prepare three <span class="label label-default">NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></span> calibration standards using the stock solution provided by the TA. You’ll need the following materials:</p>

<ol>
  <li>10 mM <span class="label label-default">NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></span> stock solution.</li>
  <li>DI water</li>
  <li>10 mL plastic test tubes</li>
  <li>precision pipettes</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">The calibration standards should cover the range of concentrations we expect our samples to fall within. For our samples, these values are approximately 0.0001 - 0.1 mM NO<sub>3</sub>. Standards may be any concentration within this range, but should have a final volume between 3-10 mL. It is up to each student to determine how to preprare their standarda. All materials and pipettes will be provided. Use following equation to help guide you in preparing your calibration standards:</p>

<p><br /><center> M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></center><br /></p>

<p align="justify">Where, M<sub>1</sub> is the concentration of the starting solution, M<sub>2</sub> is the desired concentration of the solution you’re preparing, V<sub>1</sub> is the volume taken from the starting solution, and V<sub>2</sub> is the final volume of the new solution. For example, in order to prepare 10 mL of a 0.1 mM <span class="label label-default">NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></span> solution from a stock solution of 10 mM <span class="label label-default">NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></span>:</p>

<p><br /><center>10 mM * V<sub>1</sub> = 0.1 mM * 10 mL</center><br /></p>
<center>V<sub>1</sub> = (0.1 mM * 10 mL) / 10 mM</center>
<p><br /></p>
<center>V<sub>1</sub> = 0.1 mL</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p align="justify">Taking 0.1 mL (V<sub>1</sub>) from the 10 mM starting solution (M<sub>1</sub>) and diluting it with 9.9 mL of water, gives the desired 10 mL (V<sub>2</sub>), 0.1 mM solution (M<sub>2</sub>). Use the handout provided by the TA to record the concentration and volume of the calibration standards you prepared.</p>
