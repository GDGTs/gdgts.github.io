<h2 id="icpms">Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry</h2>

<p align="justify">PAHs are a byproduct of biomass burning, and therefore occur in natural environments, but are also a product of anthropogenic activities. Some PAHs have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. These are the compounds that supposedly make grilled food carcinogenic.</p>

<p align="justify">A gas chromatograph separates and analyzes compounds by vaporizing them at increasing temperatures and directing them through a long, thin tube called a column. The column is lined with a solid phase, much like the flash columns that we learned about in the prep lab, that interacts with the compounds being analyzed. More volatile and less polar compounds interact with the column lining less, and therefore elute out of the end of the column faster than less volatile and more polar compounds. When a compound elutes, it is detected by the mass spectrometer, resulting in a peak on the chromatogram.
The mass spectrometer uses an electron beam to break the eluted compounds into smaller ions, which then are detected by mass. This allows us identify the compounds, since each compound breaks in a characteristic way.</p>
